Exported data were used to estimate individual biomass according to Lehette & Hernandez-Leon (2006) and aggregated to depth layers.

Most of the biomass was contributed by larger organisms (krill and fish) but small copepods are more abundant. Among the copepods, C.finmarchicus plays a large role both in terms of biomass and abundance.
